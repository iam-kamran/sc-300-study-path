# 1. EXAM OVERVIEW & STRATEGY {#exam-overview}

## What the Exam Tests
SC-300 does NOT test memorization. It tests your ability to:
- **Design** the right IAM architecture for a given enterprise scenario
- **Choose** between similar features based on requirements
- **Troubleshoot** broken configurations from symptoms
- **Explain** why one approach is better than another under Zero Trust principles

## Domain Weightings

| Domain | Weight | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Implement & Manage User Identities | 20–25% | High |
| Implement Authentication & Access Management | 25–30% | **Highest** |
| Plan & Implement Workload Identities & App Access | 15–20% | Medium |
| Plan & Implement Identity Governance | 25% | High |

## Zero Trust Principles — Underpin Every Answer
Microsoft embeds Zero Trust into every SC-300 question. When in doubt, apply these:
- **Verify explicitly** — Always authenticate and authorize based on all available signals (identity, location, device, service, workload, data classification).
- **Use least privilege access** — Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access, risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
- **Assume breach** — Minimize blast radius, segment access, encrypt end-to-end, use analytics to get visibility and drive threat detection.

## Exam Setup
- 40–60 questions, 150 minutes
- Question types: Single choice, multiple choice (choose 2/3), drag-and-drop, case studies
- Passing score: 700/1000
- Available in English and other languages
- Delivered via Pearson VUE

# 3. DOMAIN 1 — IMPLEMENT & MANAGE USER IDENTITIES (20–25%) {#domain-1}

---

## 3.1 Identity Models — Hybrid Authentication

### 🟢 Password Hash Synchronization (PHS)
- Entra Connect syncs a **hash of the hash** of the user's password to Entra ID — the actual password never leaves on-premises
- Authentication occurs **entirely in the cloud** — no on-premises dependency at sign-in time
- Supports: Conditional Access, Identity Protection (full fidelity including leaked credential detection), SSPR
- **Best for:** Organizations wanting simplicity, cloud resilience, and full Identity Protection capability
- **Enables:** Leaked credential detection (unique to PHS — Microsoft compares your hashed passwords against known breach databases)

### 🟢 Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)
- A lightweight agent on-premises validates passwords against AD in real time
- Authentication request passes through the cloud to on-premises — **on-premises dependency at sign-in**
- If all PTA agents go down, users cannot sign in (unless PHS is also enabled as backup)
- Does NOT enable leaked credential detection in Identity Protection
- **Best for:** Organizations that cannot allow password hashes in the cloud for compliance reasons

### 🟢 Federation (AD FS)
- Authentication handled entirely by AD FS on-premises — Entra ID trusts the AD FS token
- Most complex, highest infrastructure overhead
- Supports advanced claims transformation
- **Decommissioning path:** Microsoft recommends migrating to PHS (not PTA) for cloud resilience and full Identity Protection

### 🔴 Key Comparison Table

| Feature | PHS | PTA | Federation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth location | Cloud | On-premises (agent) | On-premises (AD FS) |
| Cloud resilience | ✅ Full | ❌ Agent required | ❌ AD FS required |
| Identity Protection (leaked credentials) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Seamless SSO compatible | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | N/A |
| Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Password never leaves on-prem | ❌ Hash synced | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/choose-ad-authn

---

## 3.2 Entra Connect Sync

### 🟢 Core Architecture
- Installed on a Windows Server on-premises
- Synchronizes AD objects (users, groups, contacts, devices) to Entra ID
- **Only one active Connect Sync server per tenant** (additional servers must be in staging mode)
- Sync cycle: default every 30 minutes (delta sync); full sync on demand

### 🟡 Staging Mode
- A second Connect server that imports and syncs locally but **does not export to Entra ID**
- Used for: disaster recovery, testing configuration changes
- To promote staging server to active: run the wizard and **disable staging mode** — no reinstall, no config import needed
- The staging server already has a current connector space — it just needs exports enabled

### 🟡 Accidental Deletion Prevention
- Blocks any sync cycle where pending **deletes exceed the threshold** (default: **500 objects**)
- The export halts; admin must explicitly confirm with `Enable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold` PowerShell cmdlet
- Configurable threshold — set lower in environments with smaller directories

### 🔴 Attribute Precedence & Conflict Resolution (Multi-Forest)
- When the same user exists in multiple forests, precedence rules in the **metaverse** determine which forest wins per attribute
- Default precedence set at install time; customizable in **Synchronization Rules Editor**
- **Source Anchor:** `ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid` (preferred) or `objectGUID` — must be unique across forests
- Misconfigured precedence = wrong attribute values win = CA dynamic groups malfunction

### 🔴 Soft Match vs Hard Match
- **Soft match:** Links cloud user to on-premises object via `proxyAddresses` or `userPrincipalName` — used during initial hybrid setup
- **Hard match:** Uses `ImmutableID` (base64-encoded objectGUID) — required when soft match fails or for recovery scenarios
- **Collision risk:** If a cloud user and a synced object represent the same person without ImmutableID alignment, they create duplicate accounts

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-syncservice-duplicate-attribute-resiliency
📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sync-feature-prevent-accidental-deletes

---

## 3.3 Entra Cloud Sync

### 🟢 Core Architecture
- Lightweight **provisioning agent** installed on-premises (not a full sync server)
- Provisioning logic runs in the **cloud** — agent just bridges the connection
- Multiple agents = high availability (no staging mode concept)
- Outbound HTTPS only — no inbound firewall ports required (Zero Trust network alignment)

### 🟡 When to Use Cloud Sync vs Connect

| Scenario | Use Cloud Sync | Use Entra Connect |
|---|---|---|
| New acquisition, minimal infra | ✅ | |
| Multiple forests → one tenant | ✅ | |
| Exchange hybrid required | | ✅ |
| Device writeback required | | ✅ |
| Group writeback required | | ✅ |
| Complex attribute mapping | | ✅ |
| SSPR password writeback | ✅ (with SSPR) | ✅ |
| Both can coexist in same tenant | ✅ | ✅ |

### 🔴 Cloud Sync Limitation Table (Exam Trap)

| Feature | Entra Connect | Cloud Sync |
|---|---|---|
| Group writeback | ✅ Yes (v2) | ❌ No |
| Device writeback | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Exchange hybrid writeback | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Password writeback (SSPR) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Provisioning to multiple tenants | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Attribute mapping customization | Full | Limited |

---

## 3.4 User & Group Management

### 🟢 Dynamic Security Groups
- Membership driven by attribute rules — no manual adds allowed
- Re-evaluated when: user attribute changes, rule is modified, manual trigger via PowerShell
- Processing time: up to **24 hours** for large tenants — not suitable for time-critical access

### 🔴 Dynamic Group Rule Operators — Case Sensitivity Trap

| Operator | Case Sensitive? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `-eq` | **Yes** (for synced attrs) | "Finance" ≠ "finance" |
| `-ne` | Yes | Opposite of -eq |
| `-contains` | No | "Sr. Analyst" matches -contains "Analyst" |
| `-match` | No | Regex, case-insensitive |
| `-startsWith` | No | |

**Exam trap:** On-premises AD attributes synced to Entra are case-preserved. A rule with `user.department -eq "Finance"` will NOT match a user with `department = "finance"` (lowercase) synced from AD.

### 🔴 Dynamic Groups Cannot
- Have members manually added
- Be used as role-assignable groups
- Be used as security groups for on-premises resource access (cloud-only)
- Have a syntax error without stopping all evaluation (broken rule = no updates for entire group)

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-membership

---

## 3.5 Administrative Units (AUs)

### 🟢 Standard AUs
- Container for scoping admin roles to a subset of users, groups, or devices
- Example: scope User Administrator role to only the Germany AU → admin can only manage German users
- Membership: static (manual) or dynamic (attribute rule, users only — not groups or devices)

### 🔴 Restricted Management AUs (RMAUs)
- **Even Global Admins are blocked** from managing objects in an RMAU unless explicitly scoped to it
- Use case: break-glass accounts, VIP executives, high-value service accounts
- This is by design — if a Global Admin gets an "Insufficient privileges" error on an RMAU object, that is expected behavior
- To grant access: assign a role explicitly scoped to the RMAU

### 🔴 Dynamic AU Membership Rules
- Only **users** support dynamic membership in AUs (devices and groups cannot)
- Same ~24-hour processing delay as dynamic groups
- Rule syntax identical to dynamic groups

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-restricted-management
📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/administrative-units

---

## 3.6 External Identities

### 🟢 B2B Collaboration
- External users invited as **guests** — a guest account is created in your tenant
- Governed by your tenant's CA policies, PIM, access packages
- Invite control: configured in External Collaboration Settings
  - Allow all users to invite
  - Only Guest Inviter role + certain admins
  - Only specific admin roles
  - Block all invitations
- Domain allow/deny list: controls which external domains can be invited

### 🟢 B2B Direct Connect
- No guest account created in your tenant
- Used exclusively for **Teams shared channels**
- Configured via cross-tenant access inbound/outbound settings
- NOT governed by access packages
- NOT fully governed by your CA policies (limited)

### 🟡 B2B Comparison Table

| | B2B Collaboration | B2B Direct Connect |
|---|---|---|
| Guest account in tenant | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| CA policies apply | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Limited |
| PIM eligible | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Access packages | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Use case | General guest access | Teams shared channels only |

### 🔴 Cross-Tenant Access Trust Settings
- You can configure your tenant to **trust MFA claims** from a specific partner tenant
- If their tenant completed MFA, your CA MFA requirement is satisfied — no second MFA prompt
- You can also trust: **Compliant device** and **Hybrid Azure AD Joined** device claims from partners
- This is configured in Entra ID → External Identities → Cross-tenant access settings → [Partner tenant] → Inbound trust settings

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview
📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/external-id/allow-deny-list

---

## 3.7 Custom Security Attributes

### 🟢 Basics
- Custom key-value pairs stored on user, application, or service principal objects
- Organized into **attribute sets** — each set contains one or more attributes
- Values are NOT visible to all users — access is controlled by role assignment
- Can be used in Azure ABAC (attribute-based access control for Azure resources)

### 🟡 Role Requirements
- **Attribute Definition Administrator:** Creates and manages attribute sets and attribute definitions
- **Attribute Assignment Administrator:** Assigns attribute values to users and apps
- These are separate roles — defining an attribute and assigning values to users require different permissions

### 🔴 What Custom Security Attributes Are NOT
- NOT usable in dynamic group membership rules (use extensionAttributes for that)
- NOT visible to regular users or apps without explicit role assignment
- NOT the same as directory extension attributes (extensionAttribute1–15) which are globally readable

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-overview

---

## 3.8 HR-Driven Provisioning (Workday → AD)

### 🟡 Architecture
1. **Workday** (HR source of truth)
2. **Entra provisioning service** (cloud, handles attribute mapping and OU targeting)
3. **Entra Connect provisioning agent** (on-premises, bridges cloud service to AD — different from Cloud Sync agent)
4. **On-premises Active Directory** (user objects created here)
5. **Entra Connect Sync** (syncs AD objects up to Entra ID)

### 🔴 Key Distinctions
- **Entra provisioning service + Connect provisioning agent** = Workday → AD (inbound to on-prem)
- **Entra Connect Sync** = AD → Entra ID (upward to cloud)
- **Cloud Sync agent** = AD → Entra ID (alternative to Connect Sync)
- **Lifecycle Workflows** = post-provisioning tasks (welcome email, TAP generation, group membership) — they do NOT create AD objects
- **MIM 2016** = legacy solution, no longer recommended

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial

---

## 3.9 Stale Guest Lifecycle Management

### 🟡 Two-Tool Approach
1. **Identification:** Stale guest account report in Identity Governance blade (uses `signInActivity` property via Graph API)
2. **Remediation:** Access review of guest users with "Block from signing in and delete within 30 days" action upon denial

### 🔴 Access Review Automation Options
- Set "No action = Deny" (not the default — default is "No response = Approve")
- Enable auto-apply results so denials take effect immediately when review closes
- Without auto-apply, results sit pending until manually applied

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/users/clean-up-stale-guest-accounts

---

# 4. DOMAIN 2 — AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS MANAGEMENT (25–30%) {#domain-2}

---

## 4.1 Conditional Access — Complete Reference

### 🟢 Policy Anatomy

**Assignments (WHO and WHAT):**
- Users and groups (include/exclude)
- Cloud apps or actions (include/exclude)
- Conditions (when to apply)

**Conditions:**
- Sign-in risk (Identity Protection signal)
- User risk (Identity Protection signal)
- Device platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS)
- Locations (named locations, all trusted, all compliant)
- Client apps (browser, mobile apps, Exchange ActiveSync, other clients)
- Device filters (rule-based expression)
- Authentication context

**Access Controls:**
- Grant: Block, Require MFA, Require Authentication Strength, Require compliant device, Require Hybrid Azure AD Joined, Require approved client app, Require app protection policy, Require password change
- Session: Sign-in frequency, Persistent browser session, App-enforced restrictions, Cloud app security (MCAS), Token protection

### 🔴 Always Test with Report-Only First
- Report-only policies evaluate but do NOT enforce
- They generate sign-in log entries showing what WOULD have happened
- Skip this step in production and you risk locking users out
- Never deploy an "All users / All apps / Block" policy directly to enabled

### 🟡 High-Yield CA Policies (Must Know All of These)

| Policy | Assignment | Condition | Grant |
|---|---|---|---|
| Require MFA for all users | All users | — | Require MFA |
| Block legacy authentication | All users | Client apps: Exchange ActiveSync + Other | Block |
| Require compliant device for admins | Directory roles (privileged) | — | Require compliant device OR Hybrid AADJ |
| Block high user risk | All users | User risk: High | Block (or Require password change) |
| Require MFA for medium sign-in risk | All users | Sign-in risk: Medium/High | Require MFA |
| Terms of Use for external users | Guest users | — | Require Terms of Use acceptance |
| Require phishing-resistant MFA for privileged roles | Privileged roles | — | Require Authentication Strength: Phishing-resistant |

---

### 🔴 Authentication Strengths (High-Frequency Gap)

Authentication Strengths define **which specific authentication methods** satisfy a CA grant control. More precise than "Require MFA."

**Built-in strengths:**

| Strength | Methods that satisfy it |
|---|---|
| Multifactor authentication | Any combination: password + any MFA method |
| Passwordless MFA | Microsoft Authenticator (passwordless), FIDO2, WHfB |
| Phishing-resistant MFA | FIDO2 security keys, Windows Hello for Business, Certificate-based auth ONLY |

**Key exam distinction:**
- Microsoft Authenticator push notification satisfies **MFA** and **Passwordless MFA** but NOT **Phishing-resistant MFA**
- Only FIDO2, WHfB, and CBA satisfy phishing-resistant strength
- Custom strengths: you can create your own (e.g., "FIDO2 or WHfB only")

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths

---

### 🔴 Device Filter Conditions

Filters use **rule expression syntax** on device attributes:

| Filter Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `device.trustType -eq "ServerAD"` | Hybrid Azure AD Joined devices only |
| `device.isCompliant -eq True` | Compliant devices only |
| `device.deviceId -in ["id1","id2"]` | Specific device IDs |
| `device.extensionAttribute1 -eq "PAW"` | Custom attribute value |

- You can **include or exclude** devices matching the filter in a single policy
- Example: Apply stricter controls to all devices where `device.isCompliant -ne True`

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-condition-filters-for-devices

---

### 🔴 Sign-in Frequency vs Persistent Browser Session

These are two distinct session controls, frequently confused:

| Control | What It Does | Exam Scenario |
|---|---|---|
| Sign-in frequency | Forces re-auth after N hours/days regardless of session activity | Admins re-authing every hour → too aggressive |
| Persistent browser session | Controls "Stay signed in?" behavior after browser close | Users signed out every time they close browser |

- Setting sign-in frequency to **Every time** = re-auth on every new session (use for PAWs, privileged roles)
- "Always persistent" + short sign-in frequency = frequent MFA prompts (common misconfiguration)

---

### 🟡 Named Locations vs Trusted Locations

- **Named location:** IP range or country that you define in CA for use in location conditions
- **Mark as trusted:** Checkbox on a named location that reduces the sign-in risk score for sign-ins from that IP
- **Trusted IPs (legacy MFA):** Per-user MFA setting bypassing MFA from specific IPs — legacy, not CA
- **Important:** Marking a location as trusted does NOT bypass CA policies — it only influences the **risk score signal**. You must create an explicit CA exclusion to bypass CA enforcement.

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/location-condition

---

### 🟡 CA for Workload Identities (Service Principals)

- CA policies can target **service principals** (app identities), not just users
- Available conditions for workload identities: **IP location only** (no device, no user risk)
- Use case: restrict which IPs a daemon application can authenticate from
- Configured in: CA blade → New policy → Users → Workload identities

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/workload-identity

---

## 4.2 Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)

### 🟢 What CAE Solves
Normally, access tokens are valid for 60–90 minutes. If a user is disabled at 2:00 PM, they can still access resources until their token expires. CAE enables near-real-time revocation.

### 🟡 How It Works
- CAE-capable apps (Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams, Microsoft Graph) **subscribe to events** from Entra ID
- When a critical event occurs, the resource provider immediately requests a new token
- If the new token request fails (account disabled, session revoked), access is blocked

### 🟡 Events That Trigger Revocation
- User account disabled or deleted
- User password changed or reset
- Admin revokes all user sessions
- User location changes outside trusted IPs (if IP-binding enabled)
- High-risk user detected by Identity Protection

### 🔴 CAE Limitations
- Only works with **CAE-capable clients** — modern Office apps, supported browsers
- Legacy clients (SMTP, IMAP, older Outlook versions) do NOT support CAE — tokens remain valid until expiry
- Revocation propagation: up to **15 minutes** (near real-time, not instant)
- If a user is still accessing resources 5–10 minutes after account disable, this is normal CAE behavior — investigate after 15+ minutes

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation

---

## 4.3 Token Protection

### 🟡 What It Does
- Binds the token to the specific device it was issued to
- Prevents **token theft/replay attacks** — even if an attacker extracts a token, they cannot use it from a different device
- Configured as a CA session control: Session → Token protection

### 🔴 Requirements
- Only works with supported apps and platforms (primarily Windows with specific apps)
- Enabling token protection on unsupported apps/platforms will block those users
- Always test with Report-Only first

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-token-protection

---

## 4.4 Authentication Methods

### 🟢 Passwordless Methods

| Method | Security Level | Best For | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FIDO2 Security Key | Highest (phishing-resistant) | High-security users, shared workstations | Hardware key required |
| Windows Hello for Business | Highest (phishing-resistant) | Windows domain-joined devices | Biometric or PIN |
| Microsoft Authenticator (passwordless) | High | Mobile-first users | Push notification, number matching |
| Temporary Access Pass (TAP) | Bootstrap only | New hire onboarding, recovery | Time-limited, single-use by default |

### 🔴 TAP Behavior
- **Single-use by default** — after use, must register a permanent method
- Configurable: multi-use for specific scenarios
- Default expiry: 1 hour (configurable)
- Use case: bootstrap MFA registration for new hires in Lifecycle Workflows

### 🔴 FIDO2 Attestation Restrictions
- Organizations can restrict which FIDO2 keys are allowed using **AAGUID** (authenticator attestation GUID)
- Example: Allow only YubiKey 5 Series, block unverified cheap keys
- Configured in: Authentication Methods → FIDO2 security key → Advanced options

### 🟡 WHfB Deployment Models

| Model | Requirements | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud-only | Entra ID joined devices | Pure cloud org |
| Hybrid — Cloud Trust | Entra Connect + no PKI needed | Recommended for hybrid |
| Hybrid — Certificate Trust | Entra Connect + on-prem PKI | Legacy hybrid deployments |
| On-premises | AD + PKI only | No cloud dependency |

**Cloud Trust** eliminates the need for on-premises PKI by using Entra ID as the trust anchor — Microsoft's current recommended model for hybrid WHfB.

## 4.5 Identity Protection

### 🟢 Risk Types

| Type | What It Measures | When Evaluated |
|---|---|---|
| Sign-in risk | Probability that THIS sign-in attempt is not from the legitimate user | Real-time at sign-in |
| User risk | Probability that the user's account is compromised | Accumulates over time (offline detections) |

### 🔴 Real-Time vs Offline Detections

| Detection | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Anonymous IP address | Real-time | Tor browser, anonymizing proxy |
| Unfamiliar sign-in properties | Real-time | New location/device for that user |
| Malware-linked IP | Real-time | Known botnet IP |
| Impossible travel | Offline | Sign-in from NYC then London 30 min later |
| Leaked credentials | Offline | Password found in breach database (PHS only) |
| Password spray | Offline | Multiple failed attempts across accounts |

**Why this matters for CA design:**
- CA sign-in risk policy catches **real-time** detections at the moment of sign-in
- CA user risk policy catches **offline** detections that elevate user risk after the fact
- You need BOTH policies for full coverage — relying only on sign-in risk leaves compromised accounts unblocked after offline detections fire

### 🔴 Remediation vs Dismissal vs Confirm Compromise

| Action | Effect | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Remediate (user resets password) | Clears user risk | Genuine compromise — credential changed |
| Dismiss risk | Closes risk entry without remediation | Confirmed false positive |
| Confirm compromise | Elevates risk, triggers additional controls | SOC confirmed actual attack |

**Critical:** Dismissing a risk does NOT change the password or revoke sessions. If the account was actually compromised, the attacker may still have access.

### 🔴 Identity Protection Policies vs CA Risk Conditions

Microsoft's **current recommendation:** Disable the legacy Identity Protection risk policies and use **CA policies with risk conditions** instead.

| | Legacy IP Policies | CA with Risk Conditions (Recommended) |
|---|---|---|
| Location | Identity Protection blade | CA blade |
| Flexibility | Low (block or MFA only) | High (any CA control) |
| Scope | All users or targeted | Fully scoped |
| Recommended | No (deprecated path) | Yes |

## 4.6 Seamless SSO

### 🟢 What It Does
- Users on domain-joined machines in the corporate network are signed in automatically to cloud apps without re-entering credentials
- Works with both PHS and PTA (not needed with federation — AD FS handles SSO natively)
- Uses Kerberos ticket from on-premises AD to obtain Entra ID token

### 🟡 Configuration Requirements
- Entra Connect: enable Seamless SSO in the wizard
- Deploy a Kerberos computer account in each AD forest (`AZUREADSSOACC`)
- Add `https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com` to the Intranet zone in IE/Edge Group Policy

# 5. DOMAIN 3 — WORKLOAD IDENTITIES & APP ACCESS (15–20%) {#domain-3}

---

## 5.1 App Registrations

### 🟢 Core Concepts
- An **app registration** = the identity of your application in Entra ID
- Creates two objects: the **Application object** (home tenant, global) and a **Service Principal** (in each tenant where the app is used)
- Every app that integrates with Entra ID must be registered

### 🟢 Permission Types

| Type | User Present? | Effective Permission | Admin Consent Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delegated | Yes | Intersection of user's permissions AND app's permissions | Not always |
| Application | No (daemon/service) | Full granted permission | Always |

**Exam trap:** Delegated permission is bounded by what the signed-in user can do. An app with `Mail.Read` delegated cannot read another user's mail — it can only read the signed-in user's mail (and only if that user has a mailbox).

### 🟡 Client Credentials
- **Client secrets:** Password-like strings; short-lived; exam always recommends certificates instead
- **Certificates:** More secure; no plaintext secret; preferred by Microsoft and the exam
- **Workload identity federation:** Eliminates secrets entirely for supported external IdPs

### 🟡 Redirect URIs
- Required for OAuth 2.0 / OIDC flows (authorization code flow, implicit flow)
- Must exactly match what the application sends in the auth request
- Not required for client credentials flow (no user redirect)

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/concept-register-app

---

## 5.2 Consent Framework

### 🟡 Consent Types

| Type | Who Consents | When |
|---|---|---|
| User consent | Individual user | Low-sensitivity delegated permissions (if user consent enabled) |
| Admin consent (tenant-wide) | Admin on behalf of all users | High-sensitivity or application permissions |

### 🔴 Admin Consent Workflow
When users request permissions requiring admin consent:
1. User is blocked at sign-in with a request form
2. Request sent to designated **reviewers** (configured in Enterprise Apps → User settings → Admin consent requests)
3. Reviewer approves or denies in the portal
4. User notified of outcome

**Exam trap:** Reviewers are configured **tenant-wide**, not per-app. Setting a reviewer applies to all admin consent requests unless further scoped.

### 🔴 Consent on Behalf of Organization
- When admin grants tenant-wide consent, a permission grant is added to the **service principal** for that app
- Revoking: delete the permission grant on the enterprise app's service principal, or remove the enterprise app entirely
- Even after revoking, if user consent is re-enabled, users could re-consent for delegated permissions

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-configure-admin-consent-workflow
📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/permissions-consent-overview

---

## 5.3 Enterprise Applications

### 🟢 SSO Types

| SSO Type | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| SAML | Token-based federation, Entra issues SAML assertion | Most SaaS apps |
| OIDC | OpenID Connect, Entra issues ID token | Modern apps |
| Password-based | Entra injects credentials into app | Legacy apps with no SSO support |
| Linked | Just a link in My Apps — no actual SSO | Informational links |
| Header-based | App Proxy injects HTTP headers | Legacy apps using header auth |

### 🟡 SCIM Provisioning
- Automates user lifecycle (create, update, disable, delete) in SaaS apps
- Entra ID pushes changes to the app's SCIM endpoint
- Attribute mappings configurable
- Provisioning scope: assigned users/groups only, or all users

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/what-is-application-management
📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/app-provisioning/use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups

---

## 5.4 Application Proxy

### 🟢 Architecture
- Publishes on-premises web apps to external users without a VPN
- **Connector:** Lightweight agent installed on-premises (Windows Server) — outbound HTTPS only
- **Pre-authentication:** Entra ID authenticates the user before the request reaches the on-premises app
- Traffic flow: User → Entra App Proxy service (cloud) → Connector → Internal app

### 🟡 Connector Groups
- Group connectors by location or purpose
- Each published app is assigned to a connector group
- A connector group must have at least one **active connector** for the app to be accessible
- Use case: European apps routed through European connectors for lower latency

### 🔴 Pre-Authentication Methods

| Method | CA Enforced? | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Entra ID (default) | ✅ Yes | All apps where Entra auth is possible |
| Passthrough | ❌ No | Apps with their own auth, legacy systems |

**Critical:** Passthrough pre-auth = **no CA enforcement**. Anyone with the external URL can reach the app's login page directly.

### 🟡 SSO Modes for App Proxy

| Mode | Requirement | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD) | Connector domain-joined + SPN configured | Windows Integrated Auth apps |
| Header-based | App reads HTTP headers | Apps using header-based auth |
| SAML | SAML-capable app | Federated apps |
| Password-based | — | Last resort for legacy apps |
| None | — | App handles its own auth |

## 5.5 Managed Identities

### 🟢 Types

| Type | Lifecycle | Sharing | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| System-assigned | Tied to the Azure resource | One resource only | Single resource needing identity |
| User-assigned | Independent resource | Multiple resources | Many resources sharing same permissions |

### 🟡 When to Use User-Assigned
If 50 Azure Functions all need access to the same Key Vault:
- Create ONE user-assigned managed identity
- Assign Key Vault Reader role to it
- Assign that identity to all 50 functions
- One RBAC assignment vs 50 separate ones with system-assigned

### 🔴 Managed Identity Limitations
- Can ONLY authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication
- Relies on the **Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)** — only available inside Azure
- **Cannot be used outside Azure** (no on-premises, no other clouds, no external workloads)
- For non-Azure workloads: use **Workload Identity Federation** instead

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview

---

## 5.6 Workload Identity Federation

### 🔴 What It Solves
Eliminates long-lived client secrets/certificates in CI/CD pipelines and external workloads by establishing a trust relationship between Entra ID and an external IdP.

### 🟡 How It Works
1. Register an app in Entra ID
2. Configure a **federated credential** on the app (points to external IdP's OIDC issuer — e.g., GitHub, Kubernetes, AWS)
3. External workload gets a token from its own IdP (GitHub Actions OIDC token)
4. Exchanges that token for an Entra ID access token — no secret required

### 🟡 Supported External IdPs
- GitHub Actions
- Kubernetes (AKS, or any OIDC-compliant K8s)
- AWS
- Google Cloud

**Zero Trust relevance:** No long-lived secrets = no secret rotation risk = no leaked credentials in pipelines.

# 6. DOMAIN 4 — IDENTITY GOVERNANCE (25%) {#domain-4}

---

## 6.1 Entitlement Management

### 🟢 Core Components

**Catalog:** A container that groups related resources (apps, groups, SharePoint sites) together. Each catalog has owners who manage what resources are in it.

**Access Package:** A bundle of resources from a catalog. Users request access to the package, not individual resources. A single package can contain multiple apps, groups, and sites.

**Policy:** Defines who can request the access package, approval requirements, and lifecycle (expiration, access reviews).

**Connected Organization:** An external organization whose users can request access packages. Linked to the organization's Entra tenant or domain.

### 🟡 Access Package Policy Types

| Policy Type | Who Can Request |
|---|---|
| For users in your directory | Members, existing guests |
| For users not in your directory | External users via connected org |
| None (admin assignment only) | Only admins can assign directly |

### 🔴 Separation of Duties (SoD) — Incompatible Packages
- You can mark two access packages as **incompatible** with each other
- If a user holds Package A, they cannot request Package B
- Use case: "Approve Purchase Orders" and "Create Purchase Orders" packages are incompatible
- This is a **native, built-in control** — no custom logic required

### 🔴 Connected Organization ≠ Cross-Tenant Access Policy
- **Connected organizations:** Entitlement Management feature — defines which external orgs can request access packages
- **Cross-tenant access policies:** Identity security feature — defines B2B trust, MFA trust, inbound/outbound collaboration rules
- These are **completely separate configurations** that serve different purposes

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-packages
📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-incompatible
📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-connected-orgs

---

## 6.2 Access Reviews

### 🟢 What Can Be Reviewed
- Group membership
- Application assignments
- Privileged role assignments (PIM roles)
- Guest user access

### 🟡 Review Scope Options

| Scope | What Is Reviewed |
|---|---|
| All members | Every user in the group/app |
| Guest users only | Only B2B guests |
| Inactive users | Users who haven't signed in for N days |

### 🟡 Decision Helpers
- **System recommendations:** Entra recommends approve/deny based on sign-in activity (inactive users get a deny recommendation)
- Reviewers can accept recommendations with one click — reduces review burden

### 🔴 "No Response" Default Behavior — Exam Trap

| Setting | Behavior | Security Impact |
|---|---|---|
| No action = Approve (default) | Unreviewed access stays | ❌ Security risk — stale access persists |
| No action = Deny (recommended) | Unreviewed access removed | ✅ Least privilege maintained |

**Always configure "No response = Deny" for security-sensitive reviews.**

### 🔴 Auto-Apply Results — Critical Distinction
- **Auto-apply disabled (default):** Review completes, results sit pending, **admin must manually apply** them
- **Auto-apply enabled:** Denied access is removed immediately when the review period closes

**Exam scenario:** 50 guests denied in a review. 7 days later all 50 accounts still active. Cause: auto-apply was not enabled.

### 🟡 Upon Denial — What Happens

| Object Type | Upon Denial |
|---|---|
| Group member | Removed from group |
| App assignment | Removed from application |
| Guest user (if selected) | Block sign-in → delete after 30 days |
| Eligible PIM role | Role assignment removed |

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview

---

## 6.3 Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

### 🟢 Assignment Types

| Type | Behavior | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Eligible | User must activate the role — NOT currently active | All privileged roles (default choice) |
| Active (time-bound) | Role is active for a defined period | Short-term projects |
| Active (permanent) | Role is always active — never expires | Break-glass only, service accounts |

**Zero Trust principle:** All privileged roles should be **eligible**, not permanently active. Permanent active assignments = PIM alert.

### 🟡 Activation Settings Per Role
Each role has configurable activation requirements:
- **Maximum activation duration:** 1–24 hours — role deactivates automatically
- **Require MFA on activation:** Even if already MFA'd for the session
- **Require justification:** Business reason text entry
- **Require ticket information:** ITSM ticket number
- **Require approval:** One or more designated approvers must approve

### 🔴 PIM Activation Flow

```
User requests activation
        ↓
MFA required? → Complete MFA
        ↓
Justification required? → Enter reason
        ↓
Ticket number required? → Enter ticket
        ↓
Approval required?
   YES → Request sent to approver(s)
         ↓
         Approver responds within timeout?
         YES → Role activates for configured duration
         NO  → Request EXPIRES and is auto-denied
   NO  → Role activates immediately for configured duration
        ↓
Duration expires → Role automatically deactivates
User returns to eligible-only status
```

### 🔴 Approval Timeout vs Activation Duration
- **Pending approval timeout:** How long a request waits for approver response before auto-denying (default: 24 hours, configurable)
- **Activation duration:** How long the role stays active after approval (1–24 hours per role config)
- These are separate — a 1-hour activation duration does NOT mean approvals expire in 1 hour

### 🔴 PIM for Entra Roles vs PIM for Azure Roles

| | PIM for Entra Roles | PIM for Azure Roles |
|---|---|---|
| Blade location | Entra ID → Roles and administrators | Azure → PIM → Azure resources |
| Scope | Tenant-wide directory roles | Azure subscriptions, resource groups, resources |
| Activation | Through Entra PIM portal | Through Azure PIM portal |
| Audit logs | Entra audit log | Azure Activity log |

These are different features in different portals. The exam tests whether you know which blade handles which role type.

### 🟡 PIM Alerts — Must Know

| Alert | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Too many Global Admins | Microsoft recommends 2–4 max |
| Permanent active role assignments | All privileged roles should be eligible |
| Roles don't require MFA on activation | Security gap |
| Roles being activated too frequently | Possible misuse or process gap |
| Duplicate role assignments | Same role eligible AND active for same user |

## 6.4 Lifecycle Workflows

### 🟢 What Lifecycle Workflows Do
Automate identity tasks triggered by HR events or schedule. They do NOT create accounts — they run tasks on existing accounts.

**Joiner → Mover → Leaver** is the core pattern.

### 🟡 Trigger Types

| Trigger | When It Fires | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Time-based (relative to attribute) | N days before/after a date attribute | 7 days before `employeeHireDate` |
| On-demand | Manually triggered | Testing or one-off exceptions |
| Attribute change (real-time) | When a specific attribute changes | `department` change triggers mover |

### 🟡 Built-in Workflow Templates

| Category | Template | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Joiner | Pre-hire onboarding | Tasks before start date |
| Joiner | New hire onboarding | Tasks on/after start date |
| Mover | Department change | Access adjustments |
| Leaver | Last day | Disable, remove access |
| Leaver | Post-offboarding | Delete, remove licenses |

### 🔴 Built-in Tasks (Must Know All)
- `Enable user account`
- `Disable user account`
- `Delete user account`
- `Add user to group`
- `Remove user from group`
- `Remove user from all groups`
- `Remove user from all Teams`
- `Send welcome email`
- `Send offboarding email`
- `Generate Temporary Access Pass` — critical for joiner workflow; new hires bootstrap MFA with TAP
- `Assign licenses`
- `Remove licenses`

### 🔴 Custom Task Extensions
When built-in tasks aren't enough:
- Register a **Logic App** as a custom task extension in the workflow
- The Logic App is called synchronously or asynchronously
- Use case: provision account in ServiceNow, create ITSM ticket, notify HR system, provision non-SCIM systems

### 🔴 Lifecycle Workflows ≠ Provisioning
- **Lifecycle Workflows:** Run tasks on existing identity objects (enable, disable, add to group, send email)
- **Provisioning service:** Creates and manages identity objects in target systems (Workday → AD, AD → Entra)
- They are complementary, not interchangeable

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/workflows-overview

---

## 6.5 Terms of Use

### 🟢 Basics
- Upload a PDF document that users must accept before accessing resources
- Enforced via a CA grant control: "Require Terms of Use acceptance"
- Acceptance records are tracked and reportable
- Can be configured per-language and per-version

### 🟡 Use Cases
- External guest users accepting collaboration terms before accessing tenant resources
- Regulatory compliance acknowledgements
- Acceptable use policies for all employees on first sign-in

### 🟡 Configuration
- Create Terms of Use policy: Entra ID → Identity Governance → Terms of Use
- Assign via CA: create a CA policy targeting desired users → Grant → Require Terms of Use

📖 https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/terms-of-use

# 7. MASTER QUICK-REFERENCE TABLES {#quick-reference}

---

## Hybrid Authentication Decision

| Requirement | Choose |
|---|---|
| Simplest setup, cloud resilience | PHS |
| Leaked credential detection (Identity Protection) | PHS (only option) |
| Password never stored in cloud (compliance) | PTA or Federation |
| Advanced claims transformation | Federation (AD FS) |
| Decommissioning AD FS | Migrate to PHS |
| On-premises auth dependency acceptable | PTA |

---

## Authentication Method Selection

| Scenario | Method |
|---|---|
| Highest security, phishing-resistant, no Windows device | FIDO2 security key |
| Windows device, biometric available | Windows Hello for Business |
| Mobile-first user, no hardware key | Microsoft Authenticator (passwordless) |
| Bootstrap MFA for new hire | Temporary Access Pass (TAP) |
| Break-glass admin account | TAP + FIDO2 |
| Privileged roles needing phishing-resistant auth | FIDO2 or WHfB (Authentication Strength) |

---

## CA Grant Controls Reference

| Grant Control | Use When |
|---|---|
| Require MFA | Any sensitive app — allows any MFA method |
| Require Authentication Strength: Phishing-resistant | Privileged roles, high-value apps — FIDO2/WHfB/CBA only |
| Require compliant device | Corporate data, Zero Trust device signal required |
| Require Hybrid Azure AD Joined | On-premises resource access, domain-joined devices |
| Require app protection policy | Mobile devices without MDM (MAM-only scenario) |
| Require Terms of Use | External users, compliance acknowledgement |
| Require password change | High user risk detected — force credential refresh |
| Block | High risk, blocked locations, legacy auth clients |

---

## Identity Protection Policy Reference

| Situation | Correct Policy |
|---|---|
| Block sign-ins with high user risk | CA: user risk ≥ High → Block |
| Force password reset for high user risk | CA: user risk ≥ High → Require password change |
| Require MFA for medium sign-in risk | CA: sign-in risk ≥ Medium/High → Require MFA |
| Offline detection (impossible travel) | Only caught by user risk policy — sign-in risk won't catch it |
| Leaked credential detected | Only available with PHS → elevates user risk |
| False positive risk | Dismiss the risk (does NOT change password or revoke sessions) |
| Confirmed compromise | Confirm compromise → triggers additional controls |

---

## PIM Assignment Decision

| Scenario | Assignment Type |
|---|---|
| Admin needs privileged role occasionally | Eligible |
| Break-glass account | Active (permanent, but in RMAU) |
| Short-term project (3 months) | Eligible (time-bound end date) |
| Service account, always needs Contributor | Active (time-bound, renewable) |
| All Global Admins | Eligible (max 2–4 active permanently) |

---

## App Permission Decision

| Scenario | Permission Type |
|---|---|
| App reads signed-in user's calendar | Delegated — Calendar.Read |
| Background service reads ALL users' mail | Application — Mail.Read |
| User approves app to read their profile | Delegated — User.Read (user consent) |
| App needs to create users in the tenant | Application — User.ReadWrite.All (admin consent) |
| Daemon app needs no user interaction | Application (always admin consent) |

---

## Lifecycle Workflow Task Selection

| Business Need | Built-in Task |
|---|---|
| New hire needs to set up MFA on day 1 | Generate Temporary Access Pass |
| Terminated employee must lose all group access | Remove user from all groups |
| New hire needs to be in the All-Staff group | Add user to group |
| Leaver's account must be blocked immediately | Disable user account |
| 30 days after termination, delete account | Delete user account |
| Non-SCIM system needs provisioning | Custom task extension (Logic App) |

---

## Access Review Decision

| Scenario | Setting |
|---|---|
| Inactive guests need removal | Scope: Guest users only + No response = Deny |
| Stale group members across all users | Scope: All members + System recommendations |
| Immediate enforcement on review close | Enable auto-apply results |
| Reviewers not responding | No response = Deny (not the default) |
| Guest cleanup after denial | "Block sign-in and delete after 30 days" |

# 8. TOP 25 EXAM TRAPS {#exam-traps}

These are the highest-frequency gotchas on the SC-300 exam. Memorize all of them.

---

**1. Authentication Strength ≠ Require MFA**
Requiring MFA allows any method including Authenticator push. Phishing-Resistant Authentication Strength only allows FIDO2, WHfB, and CBA. Authenticator push does NOT satisfy phishing-resistant strength.

**2. PHS is the ONLY method enabling leaked credential detection**
PTA and Federation do not support leaked credential detection in Identity Protection. Always choose PHS when Identity Protection full fidelity is a requirement.

**3. CA Report-Only does NOT enforce — it only logs**
A policy in Report-Only shows what WOULD have happened in sign-in logs but does not block or grant anything. Never skip this step before enabling production policies.

**4. Managed identities cannot authenticate outside Azure**
They rely on the Azure IMDS service. For GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, AWS, or any non-Azure workload: use Workload Identity Federation with an app registration.

**5. TAP is single-use and expires (default 1 hour)**
After a TAP is used to register a method, it cannot be reused. The user must register a permanent authentication method before the TAP expires.

**6. PIM eligible ≠ PIM active**
A user with an eligible role has NO privileged access until they explicitly activate it. A user with an active role has access immediately. The exam constantly conflates these.

**7. PIM for Entra roles and PIM for Azure roles are in different portals with different behaviors**
Entra roles: Entra ID blade. Azure roles: Azure portal → PIM → Azure resources. Different audit logs, different activation flows.

**8. Access review auto-apply is NOT enabled by default**
Review results sit pending until manually applied unless you explicitly check "Auto apply results to resource." Without this, denied access continues indefinitely.

**9. "No response = Approve" is the dangerous default for access reviews**
Reviewers who don't respond leave access in place. Change to "No response = Deny" for security-sensitive reviews.

**10. Connected organization ≠ Cross-tenant access policy**
Connected orgs = Entitlement Management (access packages for external users). Cross-tenant access = B2B collaboration and trust settings. These are completely separate configurations.

**11. Lifecycle Workflows do NOT create AD accounts**
They run tasks on existing objects. Account creation is done by the provisioning service (Entra provisioning service + agent, or Connect Sync). LCW + provisioning are complementary.

**12. Cloud Sync does NOT support group writeback, device writeback, or Exchange hybrid writeback**
Cloud Sync DOES support password writeback (with SSPR). This distinction is a constant exam target.

**13. App Proxy Passthrough pre-auth = zero CA enforcement**
If pre-authentication is set to Passthrough, Conditional Access does not evaluate the request. Anyone with the external URL reaches the app's own login page directly.

**14. Marking a named location as "trusted" does NOT bypass CA policies**
It reduces the sign-in risk score. It does NOT create a CA exclusion. To bypass CA, create an explicit exclusion in the CA policy.

**15. Dynamic group -eq operator is case-sensitive for synced attributes**
"finance" ≠ "Finance" when synced from on-premises AD. Normalize attribute values in AD or use -match with regex if case inconsistency is unavoidable.

**16. Dynamic group rule syntax error stops ALL evaluation for that group**
Not just the broken rule — the entire group stops updating. Monitor group processing errors in the portal.

**17. Cloud Sync provisioning agent ≠ Connect provisioning agent**
Cloud Sync agent: syncs AD → Entra ID (replaces Connect Sync for lightweight scenarios). Connect provisioning agent: enables cloud-to-AD provisioning (e.g., Workday → AD). Different binaries, different purposes.

**18. CA does NOT automatically block legacy authentication**
You must create an explicit policy targeting "Other clients" (Exchange ActiveSync, SMTP, IMAP, legacy Outlook). Without this, attackers can bypass MFA using legacy auth.

**19. Only one active Entra Connect Sync server per tenant**
Additional Connect servers must be in staging mode. Running two active Connect servers causes sync conflicts. (Cloud Sync agents have no such limitation — multiple agents are supported for HA.)

**20. RMAU blocks even Global Admins**
Objects in a Restricted Management AU cannot be modified by Global Admins unless they are explicitly scoped to that RMAU. This is by design, not a bug.

**21. CAE revocation takes up to 15 minutes — not instant**
Near real-time is not the same as instant. Investigate access after 15+ minutes, not 5 minutes.

**22. CAE only works with CAE-capable clients**
Legacy clients (SMTP, IMAP, old Outlook) don't support CAE. Their tokens remain valid until expiry (~60–90 min) regardless of account disable or session revocation.

**23. Identity Protection risk policies (legacy) are deprecated in favor of CA risk conditions**
You should disable the legacy "User risk policy" and "Sign-in risk policy" in the Identity Protection blade and use CA policies with risk conditions instead for full control.

**24. Dismissing a risk does NOT revoke sessions or change passwords**
If an account was actually compromised and you dismiss the risk instead of requiring a password change, the attacker may still have an active session.

**25. Custom security attributes require BOTH Attribute Definition Administrator AND Attribute Assignment Administrator roles**
One role creates the attribute; a different role assigns values to users. Forgetting to grant assignment permissions means the attribute exists but no one can populate it.

## Domain 4 Labs — Identity Governance

### Entitlement Management
- [ ] Create a catalog and add resources (group, app, SharePoint site)
- [ ] Create an access package with approval policy (2-stage approval)
- [ ] Configure access package lifecycle (90-day expiration, quarterly access review)
- [ ] Register a connected organization (external partner tenant)
- [ ] Create a policy for users not in your directory (external requestors via connected org)
- [ ] Configure incompatible access packages (SoD enforcement)
- [ ] Request an access package as a test user — approve as approver

### Access Reviews
- [ ] Create a group access review (all members, 30-day duration, weekly recurrence)
- [ ] Create a guest-only access review with "No response = Deny"
- [ ] Enable auto-apply results on a review — verify immediate effect on close
- [ ] Create an app assignment review
- [ ] Create a PIM role access review (eligible role review)
- [ ] Test denial outcomes: group removal, app removal, guest block+delete

### PIM
- [ ] Assign a user as Eligible for User Administrator role
- [ ] Configure activation settings: MFA + justification + approval + 4-hour max duration
- [ ] Activate the role as the eligible user — complete the full activation flow
- [ ] Test approval timeout — observe auto-denial when approver doesn't respond
- [ ] Assign PIM for Azure roles (Contributor on a subscription, eligible)
- [ ] Activate Azure role and compare flow to Entra role activation
- [ ] Review PIM audit logs — identify who activated what and when
- [ ] Review PIM alerts — identify "too many permanent assignments"

### Lifecycle Workflows
- [ ] Create a Joiner workflow triggered 7 days before employeeHireDate
- [ ] Add tasks: Generate TAP, Send welcome email, Add to group
- [ ] Create a Leaver workflow triggered on last day of employment
- [ ] Add tasks: Remove from all groups, Disable account, Send offboarding email
- [ ] Create a Mover workflow triggered by department attribute change
- [ ] Create a custom task extension pointing to a Logic App
- [ ] Run a workflow on-demand for a test user — verify task execution

### Terms of Use
- [ ] Create a Terms of Use policy (upload a sample PDF)
- [ ] Assign Terms of Use to a CA policy targeting guest users
- [ ] Sign in as a guest user — accept Terms of Use
- [ ] Review acceptance records in the portal

---

## Advanced Labs (Gap Coverage)
- [ ] Configure Authentication Strength: custom strength requiring FIDO2 only
- [ ] Create CA policy with device filter (exclude PAW devices from MFA requirement)
- [ ] Configure FIDO2 key restriction by AAGUID
- [ ] Test soft match during initial Connect Sync setup
- [ ] Test hard match (set ImmutableID to recover broken sync)
- [ ] Configure WHfB Cloud Trust hybrid deployment
- [ ] Test access package SoD enforcement (attempt to hold incompatible packages)
- [ ] Test Workload Identity Federation (GitHub Actions exchanging OIDC token for Entra token)
- [ ] Configure RMAU and test Global Admin block behavior
